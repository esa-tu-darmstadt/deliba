3. DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY
4. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

6. SUPPORT



1. OVERVIEW

This readme describes how to use the files that come with UG947, the 
Dynamic Function eXchange Tutorial for Vivado.

This design targets the KC705 demonstration platform by default and is used to 
highlight the software flow for Dynamic Function eXchange.  It can also be used to 
target the VC707, VC709, and AC701 demonstration platforms.


2. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This tutorial requires Xilinx Vivado 2020.2 or newer.


3. DESIGN FILE HIERARCHY

The directory structure underneath this top-level folder is described below:

\Bitstreams
 |   This folder is empty and will be the target location for bitstream generation.
 |       
\Implement
 |   This folder is the target location for checkpoints and reports for each of
 |   of the design configurations.  Two subfolders are present, ready for 
 |   implementation results.
 |
 +-----  \Config_shift_right_count_up_implement
 |        This is the location for the first configuration results.
 |
 +-----  \Config_shift_left_count_down_import
 |        This is the location for the second configuration results.
 |
\Sources
 |
 +-----  \hdl
 |       Verilog source code is located within these folders.  There are folders
 |       for static logic (top) and each reconfigurable module variant
 |    
 |           +--\count_down
 |           +--\count_up
 |           +--\shift_left
 |           +--\shift_right
 |           +--\top
 |
 +-----  \xdc 
 |        This folder contains the design constraint files.  
 |        Each filename includes an extension to define which device it targets.
 |           top.xdc is the complete constraint file for automatic scripted processing
 |           top_io.xdc contains pinout and clocking constraints
 |           pblocks.xdc contains the DFX floorplan
 |           top_io.xdc + pblocks.xdc = top.xdc
 |
\Synth
 |   This folder contains empty folders that will receive the post-synthesis
 |   checkpoints for all the modules of the design.
 |
 +-----  \count_down
 +-----  \count_up
 +-----  \shift_left
 +-----  \shift_right
 +-----  \Static
 |
 \Tcl_HD
 |   This folder contains all the lower-level Tcl scripts invoked by the Tcl
 |   scripts at the top level.  The readme.txt is located here.  Any 
 |   modifications to accommodate user designs should be done to run_dfx.tcl or
 |   advanced_settings.tcl in the top level, not with these scripts here.
 

4. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

Follow the instructions provided in UG947 Lab 1 to run the tutorial.

To compile a full design, edit run_dfx.tcl and set all flow control steps to 1 and
uncomment the "exit" command at the bottom.
Open the Tcl Shell from Vivado 2020.2 or newer, navigate to this folder, 
and type the following on the command line:

source run_dfx.tcl -notrace

This will compile the entire design, from RTL to bitstreams.  

The tutorial, uses the default flow control settings in run_dfx.tcl so that it only
runs synthesis and leaves the Tcl Shell open for further actions.

If a device other than the 7K325T is desired, open advanced_settings.tcl and change 
the xboard variable to target a different board/device.


5. OTHER INFORMATION 

For more information on Dynamic Function eXchange in Vivado, please consult UG909.
