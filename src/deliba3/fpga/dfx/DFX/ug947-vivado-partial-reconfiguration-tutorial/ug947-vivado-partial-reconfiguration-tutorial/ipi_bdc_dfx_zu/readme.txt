Block Design Container tutorial for Dynamic Function eXchage
Production version for use with Vivado 2021.2 and newer


To automate the hardware build using Vivado, launch the full flow by calling:

vivado -mode tcl -source run_all.tcl


Alternatively, open run_all.tcl to see all the individual tcl scripts called.
Use these scripts one by one to create an IPI project, create all portions of the design,
compile the design through synthesis and implementation, generate full and partial programming images,
and create XSA images for Petalinux.
