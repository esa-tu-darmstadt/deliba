*************************************************************************

This project is self reconfiguring version of the up/down left/right DFX tutorial
for the KC705, VC707 or VC709 boards.  This design has been validated with Vivado 2020.2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Generate the DFX Controller & other IP required for the design, then implement the design 
   ---------------------------------------------------
   vivado -mode tcl -source design.tcl

   Selection of the target board is done within this script.
   

2. Create a PROM file containing the static and the partials
   ---------------------------------------------------
   * This creates Bitstreams/dfx_prom.mcs containing the static and the partials
   * NOTE: This contains hardwired addresses for the partials in the ROM.  
           It MUST match the hardwired addresses in dfx_info.tcl 
   * NOTE: These sizes match bitstreams created by Vivado 2016.1 and newer tools.
           Changes in 2016.1 require modifications to match size changes from prior versions of software
		   The first published version of UG947 with the PR Controller lab was with 2016.1.
		   The 2016.3 version of UG947 added support for VC707 and VC709 boards.
		   The 2020.1 version migrates the IP from PR to DFX.
   * NOTE: The design script that generates the design IP (gen_ip_<board>.tcl) has version-specific information.
           The current archive is compatible with Vivado 2020.2 and DFX Controller IP version 1.0.
     
   vivado -mode tcl -source create_prom_file_<board>.tcl
    

3. Download the PROM image
   ---------------------------------------------------
   You will likely need to Refresh the device in Vivado Hardware Manager.
   Press the PROG button on the demonstration platform to program the device from flash.
   

4. Reconfiguration is triggered by the NSEW buttons:
   ---------------------------------------------------
   N: Up counter
   S: Down Counter
   W: Shift Left
   E: Shift Right
   C: Reset
   

5. Using the AXI Interface
   ----------------------------
   In Vivado Hardware Manager, source this script file to set up dfxc commands
     source ./Sources/scripts/axi_lite_procs.tcl 
     dfxc_jtag_setup         
     dfxc_shutdown_vsm          vs_shift
     dfxc_show_rm_configuration vs_shift 0
     dfxc_show_rm_configuration vs_shift 1
     dfxc_decode_status         vs_shift

   Other commands exist to access the AXI IF  
     dfxc_read_register  reg_name
     dfxc_write_register reg_name data
