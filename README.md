DeLiBA
===========================================
This repository contains the source code for Development of Linux Block I/O Accelerators (DeLiBA) which is being developed at ESA group. DeLiBA lifts key functionality of Linux block I/O layer up into userspace, enabling the use of a wide spectrum of programming tools. For an initial proof-of-concept DeLiBA in current state uses Ceph based libraries. And to accelerate the Linux block I/O stack computations, it currently uses FPGA-based based hardware accelerators.
